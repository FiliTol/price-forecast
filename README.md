## Normalization, transformation, grouping

- [ ] Transform other not-normally distributed variables in order to make them normally distributed. Use techniques like [`power_transform`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.power_transform.html).
- [ ] After transformations set the normalization parameter to true in order to scale them immediately with the sklearn `power_transform` transformer.
